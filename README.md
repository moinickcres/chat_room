# Chat Room User Manual

## Introduction
Upon entering the application, you are greeted with a welcome screen.

## Navigation Menu
The top menu displays:
- The application name.
- A "Chat Rooms" section to access the different chat rooms.
- A "Home" button to return to the main menu.
- A "Privacy" section.

## Chat Rooms
1. In the "Chat Rooms" section, you can join one of the available chat rooms: **Beers**, **Programming**, or **Fashion**.
   - For example, entering the **Beers** room will allow you to:
     - See your username and a text box to type messages.
     - Send a message by clicking the "Send" button.
     - Your username will remain saved, and the text box will clear for the next message.
     - Open multiple chat room windows to allow new users to join.

2. Behavior with New Users:
   - When a new user joins the same room, they will not see previously sent messages but will see any new ones.
   - Similarly, users already in the room will only see new messages sent after the new user joins.
